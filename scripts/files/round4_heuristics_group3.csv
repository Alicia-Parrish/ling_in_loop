not_obvious,write something that is not obvious,"A not obvious statement would be one that you would have to think on before determining its relationship to the text. Maybe this means a reader would have to go back and read the sentence a second time to understand it. Often, this can be accomplished by using a more complex sentence structure, focusing on something that can be inferred from the text but isn’t explicitly stated, or by focusing on some crucial relationship between two ideas/people/timepoints in the text.",Each statement you provide that conforms to this restriction will add on a $0.07 bonus.

grammar_change,"change grammatical info like tense, plurality, or gender","Changing the grammar of a sentence often changes the circumstances in which it is true. For example, the sentence ""I left the bar."" might be false, even if ""I will leave the bar."" is true. Similarly, ""I saw her yesterday."" is true under different circumstances than ""I saw him yesterday."" or ""I saw them yesterday."" In the first case, we changed the tense of the verb ""leave"" from past to future. In the second case, we changed the gender and number of the pronoun: ""him"" is a singular masculine pronoun, ""her"" is a singular feminine pronoun, and ""them"" is a plural pronoun or singular gender-neutral pronoun. All of these pronouns are used in different contexts.",Each statement you provide that conforms to this restriction will add on a $0.07 bonus.

no_overlap,do not reuse any words from the text,"We ask you to come up with sentences that do not use the same noun, verb, adjective, and adverb appearing in the original text. This, however, does not mean that you have to change the function words. In other words, you can reuse words such as <em>the, can, should, that, at, in, near, and, but, any, he, she, they, is, was</em>, etc.","Adding this restriction to the maybe correct or definitely incorrect statement will add a bonus of $0.05. Because it's often more challenging to add this restriction to a maybe correct or definitely correct statement, doing so is worth a bonus of $0.10.","does not reuse nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs from the text",$0.10 ,$0.05 ,$0.05 ,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBdLV_H0pYWweSsO3cpV515q1k9c-uzvQTpqKu2-xN0/edit#bookmark=kix.nmqibxbogrpl
