So if the sentence is ""the girl will climb the tree"", it's okay to write something like ""the tree will be climbed by the girl"", where you have to add -ed to the verb in order to keep the sentence correct. <br />

So in a sentence like ""Jonah ate his cereal in the morning"", don't just put ""Jonah ate his cereal""; you should make some change to this sequence of words, such as by writing ""Jonah ate in the morning"" or ""The cereal got eaten by Jonah"".","After we verify your work was correct, you'll receive a bonus of $0.07 for each individual sentence that you apply this constraint to in this HIT. <br />
