external_knowledge,"write something that relies on something that is not explicitly stated, but is part of common knowledge","For example, the text may (i) focus on a fact that can be inferred from the text but isn't explicitly stated, (ii) play with the chronology of events, (iii) use wordplay like homonyms, or (iv) rely on common knowledge, such as the fact that a potato sack can hold things that aren't potatoes or that an elephant is an especially large animal. We are particularly hoping that you will come up with examples unlike what you’ve written in past rounds or seen in validations.",Each statement you provide that conforms to this restriction will add on a $0.10 bonus.

register_change,change the level of formality of the text,"For example, you could either elevate the formality level to sound fancier (like in a speech at a banquet where the speaker really wants to impress everyone), or you can lower the formality level, as if the text were something you would say to an old friend when it's just the two of you chatting. Making the phrasing of your sentence match the way you might say it to a child, the way you might say it in a poem, the way you might say it while giving a sermon, etc. also satisfy this constraint.",Each statement you provide that conforms to this restriction will add on a $0.07 bonus.

no_overlap,do not reuse any words from the text,"We ask you to come up with sentences that do not use the same noun, verb, adjective, and adverb appearing in the original text  (including proper nouns, such as the name of a person or the name of a city). This, however, does not mean that you have to change the function words. In other words -- you can reuse words such as <em>the, can, should, that, at, in, near, and, but, any, he, she, they, is, was</em>, etc.","Adding this restriction to the maybe correct or definitely incorrect statement will add a bonus of $0.05. Because it's often more challenging to add this restriction to a definitely correct statement, doing so is worth a bonus of $0.10.","does not reuse nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs from the text",$0.10 ,$0.05 ,$0.05 ,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBdLV_H0pYWweSsO3cpV515q1k9c-uzvQTpqKu2-xN0/edit#bookmark=kix.nmqibxbogrpl
all_overlap,only reuse words that appear in the text,"This means that every contentful word that appears in the statement must have appeared in the text as well. However, it's acceptable to introduce new 'function words', such as <em>the, can, should, that, at, in, near, and, but, any, he, she, they, is, was</em>, etc. It's also acceptable to change the tense of a verb or to make a noun plural/singular in order to make sure the sentence is grammatically correct.","Adding this restriction to the definitely correct statement will add a bonus of $0.05.
