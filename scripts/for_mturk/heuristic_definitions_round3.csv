sub_part,the statement uses your knowledge about the sub-parts of something in the text,"For example, some sub-parts of a bus might include its door, steering wheel, or engine. Sub-parts of a dog might include its ears, paws, or tail. Sub-parts of a book might include its pages, title, or characters. So, if you get a text that mentions a book, your statement could reference its pages. That is, given the text ""Emily set the book on fire,"" a definitely true statement is ""Emily burned the pages"" since it's not reasonably possible to set a book on fire and leave its physical sub-parts unburnt."
hyponym,the statement uses a more specific term for a word in the text,"For example, if the text contains the word ""dog"" a more specific word could be ""puppy"" or ""poodle."" Here are some additional examples: ""truck"" is more specific than ""vehicle,"" ""a pie"" is more specific than ""a baked good,"" and ""icy"" is more specific than ""cold."""
hypernym,The statement uses a less specific term for a word in the text,"For example, if the text contains the word ""dog"" a less specific word could be ""canine"", ""mammal"" or ""animal"". Here are some additional examples: ""vehicle"" is less specific than ""car""; ""hot"" is less specific than ""boiling"", and ""a ball"" is less specific than ""a baseball""."
antonym,the statement uses an antonym of a word in the text,"For example, if the text contains the word ""happy"", an antonym could be ""sad"". Here are some additional examples of antonym pairs: day / night; above / below; bright / dim; stormy / clear; accept / decline."
reverse_argument_order,the statement reverses the order of 2 nouns or noun phrases in the text,"Noun phrases are words or expressions that refer to people, places, things, or ideas, and can serve as subjects or objects of sentences (e.g., ""the frying pan"", ""a speech"", ""three orange cats""). A common way of reversing the order of nouns is making an active sentence (""Lucy climbed the tree"") passive (""The tree was climbed by Lucy"") or vice versa, but this is not the only way."
