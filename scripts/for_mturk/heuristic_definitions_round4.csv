not_obvious,the statement relies on something not obvious (not explicitly states; you had to read it twice; etc.),"For example, the text may have a complex sentence structure, focus on something you need to infer from the text, or focus on some crucial relationship between two idea/people/timepoints. Basically, if you felt like you had to think about this one more than normal or read the text a couple more times to be sure, select 'yes'."
grammar_change,"the statement changes grammatical information (tense, plurality, pronoun gender) from the text","For example, the text may change the present tense verb in ""She runs"" to past tense, ""She ran."" It could also change the pronoun's gender, to become ""He runs"". It could also change a noun like ""dog"" to the plural ""dogs""."
no_overlap,"The statement does not reuse any nouns, verbs, or adjectives from the text","This means that any contentful word that appears in the text cannot be repeated. However, it's acceptable to repeat 'function words', such as <em>the, can, should, that, at, in, near, and, but, any, he, she, they, is, was</em>, etc."
all_overlap,"The statement only uses the nouns, verbs, or adjectives from the text","This means that every contentful word that appears in the statement must have appeared in the text as well. However, it's acceptable to repeat 'function words', such as <em>the, can, should, that, at, in, near, and, but, any, he, she, they, is, was</em>, etc. It's also acceptable to change the tense of a verb or to make a noun plural/singular in order to make sure the sentence is grammatically correct."
