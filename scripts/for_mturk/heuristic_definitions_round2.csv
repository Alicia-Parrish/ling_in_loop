relative_clause,,
synonym_antonym,the statement uses a synonym or antonym for one of the words in the text.,"For example, if the text describes something as 'small', a statement that meets this restriction might use a synonym like 'tiny' or an antonym like 'big' in its description. In that case, you would select 'yes'."
temporal_reasoning,the statement references two distinct time points relevant to the text.,"For example, the text may mention that something that happened before or after some event. If the statement references both those time points, then select 'yes'. Here are some expressions that are commonly used in referencing two time points in the same sentence: 'meanwhile', 'at the moment', 'earlier than', 'later on', 'before', 'after', 'in between', 'prior to' and so on."
background_knowledge,the statement relies on background information or general knowledge.,"For example, the text may refer to an event that happened on Christmas. If the statement mentions the event taking place in the December, then determing whether the statement is correct/incorrect relies on knowing that Christmas is in December (we consider this 'background knowledge' about when Christmas happens), and you should select 'yes'. "
hypernym_hyponym,the statement uses a more specific or less specific category for a word in the text.,"For example, if the text mentions something about a dog, the statement may mention a category more specific than 'dog', such as 'poodle', or it may mention a less specific category, such as 'mammal' instead of using the word 'dog' that appeared in the text. In either case, you would select 'yes'."
reverse_argument_order,the statement reverses the order of two nouns from the text.,"For example, if the text has the phrase 'the prime minister travelled to Siberia', then if the statement has 'Siberia' occurring before 'the prime minister' (as in 'Siberia is where the prime minister visited'), then you should select 'yes'."
